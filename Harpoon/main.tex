\section{Weapons}

\subsection{Harpoon}
The harpoon is a weapon used for hunting whales.
It is basically a spear attached to a rope.

Watch out if you can hear someone shout ``There she blows!''.

\begin{DndTable}{XX}
    \textbf{Property}  & \textbf{Value} \\
    Cost & 10 gp \\
    Damage & 1d6 Piercing \\
    Weight & 6 lbs \\
    Thrown & 20/30 \\
    Versatile & 1d6 \\
    Tether & 30 \\
    Stuck & 1d4 Slashing / 1d8 Slashing \\
    Properties & Special, Stuck, Tether, Thrown, Versatile
\end{DndTable}

\subparagraph{Special (Harpoon)}
When the harpoon is dropped on the battlefield, because of a missed throw or after removal, you can use a bonus action to pull it back.

\subsection{Speargun}
A device, to shoot a small harpoon.
It uses a spring mechanism to shoot a tethered projectile.

\begin{DndTable}{XX}
    \textbf{Property}  & \textbf{Value} \\
    Cost & 75 gp \\
    Damage & 1d4 Piercing \\
    Weight & 10 lbs \\
    Range & 40/60 \\
    Ammunition & 1 \\
    Tether & 60 \\
    Stuck & 1d4 Slashing / 1d8 Slashing \\
    Properties & Ammunition, Loading, Range, Special, Stuck, Tether, Two-Handed
\end{DndTable}

\subparagraph{Special (Speargun)}
When the projectile is dropped on the battlefield it is automatically pulled back by a spring mechanism inside the speargun and will be loaded for the next attack.

\subsection{Properties}

\subparagraph{Tether}
When an attacker hits a target, they become tethered to each other.
A tethered creature's movement is limited by the distance of the tether.

When trying to move out of the maximum distance of the tether, the moving creature tries to drag the one at the other end of the tether around.
The maximum distance is given explicitly in feet.

To pull, the moving creature must make a Strength (Athletics) check.

\begin{center}
    \mbox{\bf Pull check DC} = \mbox{10} + \mbox{pulled creature's Strength modifier}
\end{center}

On a successful check, the creature can move freely and drag the other creature around.
On a failed save, the creature's movement is still constrained by the maximum distance of the tether.

\subparagraph{Stuck}
A weapon or projectile gets stuck, when it hits a target.
Anyone in reach can use an action to remove the stuck item.

When removing a stuck item, you must make a Wisdom (Medicine) check (DC 10). 
The stuck property lists two damage values.
The left one will be dealt to the target on a successful check and the right one on a failed check.
